## React components:
    - Website Header/navigation
    - Blog header/navigation
    - Body
        - home
        - about
        - blog main
        - contact
        - services
    - Footer

## Steps:

    1. Convert pages into react components
    2. Convert HTML to JSX - class to className, check for self closing tags
    3. Add CSS to react components
    4. Install dependencies via npm and import into corresponding components

## Design TODOs:
    1. Media queries for mobile first approach
    2. Browser tests and adjust scale as needed
